BrandYou shops are distinguished throughout the world by their strategic location and well-detailed architecture. The establishments are converted into spacious trend-setting showcases with a carefully thought through image extending from the windows to th arrangement of the goods inside. Bershka selects the best commercial sites in each city and positions itself in the most notable areas of the main shopping centres. Unique buildings are often chosen, which the Bershka architectural studio refurbish and adapt to its brand image and philosophy.</p>
